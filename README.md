# Developing a Loss-Given-Default Model

The goal of this project is to implement a simple practical implementation of
a selected credit risk model, in this case a Loss-Given-Default (LGD) model.

The interface to the developed model is implemented as a R Shiny App, which is
deployed and accessible via [betiko.shinyapps.io/acrm/](https://betiko.shinyapps.io/acrm/).

For details please see the presentation of this project which is accessible via
